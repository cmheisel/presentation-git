						<h2>What?</h2>
						<p>It's a way to track changes to files</p>
					  <p>What changed...</p>
					  <p>Who changed it...</p>
					  <p>When they changed it...</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why?</h2>
					<p>Semi-infinite undo button</p>
					<p>Ease collaboration</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Repositories</h2>
				  * Collection of files/folders and ALL of the changes that've been made to them
				  * .git folder
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Clone</h2>
				  * Make a copy of the entire repository onto my machine
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Change sets</h2>
				  * Make changes to code
				  * Add them to the stage
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Commit</h2>
				  * A set of changes permanently added to the history
				  * An undo point
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Push</h2>
				  * Send my changes up to the remote copy of the repository
				  * Why? What happens if my laptop catches on fire
				  * Or I want my friends to see the changes
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Branch</h2>
				  * A set of commits occurring from a moment in the history of another Branch
				  * Really it's a way for people working on different to do it in relative isolation
				  * It's like your code goes on a vacation and doesn't check twitter or facebook for a while
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Merging</h2>
				  * But in reality you want to stay mostly up to date with your teammates
				  * Brings all the changes from the target branch into the destination branch
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Pull request</h2>
				  * Kind madam or sir, I hereby present this difference between my branch and your branch for your consideration
				  * Results in a merge
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Fork (Github)</h2>
				  * You want to make some changes to someone elses code
				    * Because someone is wrong on the Internet
				  * You could clone their repository
				    * But clones can die in a fire unless...
				    * You have a remote repository you can push to
				  * A fork is your personal, remote copy of their code at the moment you fork it
				  * You can clone it locally
				  * Make changes
				  * and PR
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Github flow</h2>
				  * How most folks use it
				  * Branch
				  * Commit
				  * Test
				  * Merge and deploy
